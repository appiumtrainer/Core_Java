 Difference between them.
 1: Concreate Arrays    : Size can't grow and can't take diff datatype values.
 2: Object Arrays          :  Size can't grow but takes diff datatype values.
 3: Collections Arrays  : Size can grow and takes diff datatype values too.
Relationship. Using different class objects in ObjectArrays. The another class is assign1_diffbetween_Arrays_ObjectArrays_ArrayList_Subclass
